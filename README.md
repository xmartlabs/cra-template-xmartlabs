# Xmartlabs Create React App Template

This project contains Xmartlabs' Create React App template. In an effort to be DRY this Readme only contains information on how to contribute to the template. If you want to know more about what the template itself provides, then read the template's Readme located in [`/template/README.md`](./template/README.md).

## Setup

Make sure you have the appropriate version of Node (14.4.0) and NPM (6.14.5) installed.

Then install the required packages:

```shell
npm install
```

To run tests you'll need to create a `.env` file. You can simply copy the example file (`.env.example`) and rename it. In general, since the environment file will be used only for testing, any value for the environment variables will work.

Tests are run using the typical command:

```shell
npm test
```
