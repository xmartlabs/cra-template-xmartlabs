This project was generated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [Xmartlabs' template](https://github.com/xmartlabs/cra-template-xmartlabs).

## Post Install

After creating a project with this template you need to take some extra steps to finish the setup.

* Remember to rename the `eslintrc.yml` file to `.eslintrc.yml` (add the initial dot).
* Add the `clearMocks: true` option to the Jest configuration on the package.json file (read below).

### Jest Configuration

To have tests run correctly you need to override the default options of Jest. To do this you simply need to add a `jest` key on your package JSON with the following content:

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "clearMocks": true
  }
}
```

## Running Tests

```shell
npm test
```

## Project structure

The `src` directory has the following structure:

* `assets`: This directory contains all global assets. This includes images and stylesheets used in multiple components.
* `common`: React components used across multiple pages of the SPA.
* `config`: Global app configuration files go here (e.g. a constants file).
* `helpers`: Javascript files that provide helper functions to the app. These are not React components.
* `hocs`: Higher Order Components are stored here.
* `models`: Models (abstractions of data) go here.
* `networking`: Includes all code related to networking.
  * `controllers`: All controllers of the app go here.
  * `serializers`: All serializers of the app go here.
* `pages`: React components that are entrypoints for a page of the SPA.
* `routes`: All configuration related to routing of the pages goes here.

## Routing

This project uses [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) to generate routing between the pages. We've created an abstraction over React Router to make it safer to operate with paths and have some other useful helpers. This section explains how this abstraction works and how to add a new route.

### Routing structure

Our main objective is to have routes declared centrally and reused across the app. This avoids common issues like typos when writing paths. Configuration of the routes is stored on `src/routes/routes.js`. We store information of the routes, such as the name of the route and path. More information can be added to the `routes` object, considering it is later passed as props to the `Route` component of React Router. You'll notice that there's no React component linked to the route.

The mapping between routes and React components is done in `src/route-components.js`. We do this in a separate component since it makes it easier to support [URL Splitting](https://blog.xmartlabs.com/2019/05/17/url-splitting/) later on. This isn't configured by default, so you'll have to do some more work to enable URL Splitting.

Some helpers have been defined, such as `AppLink` and `AppRedirect`. These are wrappers of the typical `Link` and `Redirect` of React Router. The advantage of these helpers is that they provide a different props API. Instead of having a `to` prop where you just pass the exact path and query string, they accept three different props:

* `routeName`: The name of the target route. Obtained from the routes file as detailed above.
* `pathParams`: A map of path params. Examples below.
* `queryParams`: A map of query params. Examples below.

It is highly encouraged that you use these helpers instead of the native ones of React Router. If you need more functionality, implement it on the helpers directly. Another useful helper is `goToPage`, which is a function that receives the same parameters. The difference is that you can use this function to imperatively trigger a route change.

### Creating a Route

* Create a new page component on the `pages` directory. This component will serve as an entrypoint to the page.
* Add a name for the new route on `src/routes/routes.js`. Then, on the same file, add an entry to the routes object specifying the path of the route.
* Add an entry to the object on `src/route-components.js` that links the name you defined previously to the component you created on the pages directory.

And that's it. If you defined the path correctly you should be able to access the component on that route. There are already examples on all of these files, so you should be able to follow them.

**NOTE:** please define routes in order of specificity (more specific routes should come before) to avoid a less specific route matching before. You can also add the `exact: true` configuration option to the route on `src/routes/routes.js` to avoid matching less specific routes.

### Using the helpers

Let's imagine we have a route to the homepage `/home` and we have named it `home` on our routes object. In order to link to it from another page we must render an `AppLink` component like so:

```jsx
<AppLink routeName={routeNaming.HOME} />
```

This will route your page to `/home` once clicked. Let's assume the route also receives a path parameter `id` (`/home/:id`) and also we want to pass some query parameters. Path parameters and query parameters are specified by Javascript objects, like this:

```jsx
<AppLink
  routeName={routeNaming.HOME}
  pathParams={{ id: 'foo' }}
  queryParams={{ bar: 'baz', bar2: 'baz2' }}
>
```

This link will link to `/home/foo?bar=baz&bar2=baz2`. It's worth noting that the `Redirect` component also has the same prop interface, and the `goToProps` helper accepts three parameters with the same names, so you should feel at home when using all three of them.

## Component Layouts

Most of the times multiple pages of your app will share similar features. For example, 90% of your pages might have a navbar and a footer. It's really not practical to go around placing a navbar on ALL of your pages manually. Component layouts come to the rescue!

You'll find a Higher Order Component named `withLayout` on the `hocs` directory. This component is quite simple, it simply wraps the component in a `Layout` component, expecting also a parameter named `layoutType`.

The `Layout` component will be your best friend. It's only a matter of defining what layout types you want to have and then implement them inside this component. You might have a layout that only includes a navbar, or one that only has a footer, or both. Even one that doesn't have anything except the wrapped component.

You can apply the HOC like so:

```js
withLayout(LAYOUT_TYPES.MY_LAYOUT_TYPE, Component);
```

This could turn your `Component` from this:

```jsx
<div>
  <h1>My component</h1>
</div>
```

To this:

```jsx
<div>
  <Navbar>
  <div>
    <h1>My component</h1>
  </div>
  <Footer>
</div>
```

It's just an example though. Be mindful of components you'll probably need across multiple pages and a layout will probably help you include them seamlessly! Remember though that not everything can be solved with a layout.

## Networking

This is a very compact section that explains networking. For a more in-depth explanation refer to [this blogpost on the subject](https://blog.xmartlabs.com/2020/07/09/frontend-architecture-and-best-practices/).

"Networking" in this context means communication between the frontend and any kind of backend or service we need to consume. And it can be hard sometimes. APIs can sometimes change unexpectedly or be badly organized in terms of the data they provide. It's the job of the developer to protect its frontend against the backend menace.

That's why this project implements a particular networking pattern that involves three distinct elements:

* Controllers: handle the specific networking calls needed to fetch data or modify the state of the system on the backend.
* Serializers: receive fresh data from the controller and transform it to remove unnecessary data, rename fields and prepare it to be fed into a model.
* Models: abstractions of data that represent concepts of our frontend app. Typically instantiated with deserialized data from a serializer.

### Controllers

All networking calls must be made in controllers. They are in charge of knowing where to go to fetch data, what kind of HTTP method to use, etc. You'll probably make a request at some point that returns data. Controllers are also in charge of deserializing the data via a serializer and instantiating models accordingly. Here's an example:

```js
// src/networking/controllers/example-controller.js
import { Example } from 'src/models/example';
import { ExampleSerializer } from '../serializers/example-serializer';
import { ApiService } from '../api-service';
import { API_ROUTES } from '../api-routes';

class ExampleController {
  static async getExamples() {
    const response = await ApiService.get(API_ROUTES.EXAMPLE);
    const deSerializedExample = ExampleSerializer.deSerialize(response.data);
    return new Example(deSerializedExample);
  }
}

export { ExampleController };
```

### Serializers

Serializers act as a sort of firewall of data by deserializing data served by the API. Any kind of structured data that is returned by the API should be deserialized.

The advantage of this is that you can redefine the fields of the data and remove unused ones.

```js
// src/networking/serializers/example-serializer.js
class ExampleSerializer {
  static deSerialize(data) {
    return {
      foo: data.foo,
      bar: data.bar,
    };
  }
}

export { ExampleSerializer };
```

### Models

Models represent concepts of your app. Typically you'll use them together with controllers and serializers, where deserialized data will be fed to a model to instance it.

```js
// src/models/example.js
class Example {
  constructor(params) {
    this.foo = params.foo;
    this.bar = params.bar;
  }
}

export { Example };
```

## Component Styling

React apps can be styled in multiple ways. This project supports and is built to use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) on Sass to style React components. This section explains how to style components and what to take into account.

### Local Styles

Components will probably need CSS that is local to them. If you need to do this simply create a Sass file with the same base name as the component, and under the same directory. For example:

```jsx
// src/components/button/button.jsx
import React from 'react';

import styles from './button.module.scss';

const Button = () => (
  <button className={styles.container}>
    This is a
    <span className={styles.highlight}>
      button!
    </span>
  </button>
);

export { Button };
```

```scss
/* src/components/button/button.module.scss */
.container {
  width: 100px;
}

.highlight {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Our PostCSS plugin will mangle the names of the classes inside any module (make sure you name modules with the `.module.scss` extension or this won't work) to reduce the probability of collisions between classes across multiple components. In this case, for instance, the name of the `container` class will be changed to something like `button__container__23h2k`.

### Global Styles

Typically when using Sass you'll probably have global stylesheets that can be imported and reused across other Sass files. Global styles in this project are stored on `src/assets/stylesheets` directory. There you'll find:

* `base-styles.scss`: file that sets the default styles for elements. Helps normalize styles across the whole page. Try to keep these as limited as possible, avoid over-styling elements.
* `breakpoints.scss`: breakpoint-related file. Exports container classes and some other magic. (More on this on following sections)
* `colors.scss`: compilation of all color variables used in the project.
* `fonts.scss`: font-face configurations of all fonts used on the project. Not needed unless you're using locally-stored fonts.
* `global-styles.module.scss`: global module that exports conflicting classes (more on this below).
* `mixins.scss`: file that includes all mixins used on the project.
* `text-styles.scss`: includes all text-style classes used on the project. Typically used along with design systems (more on this below).
* `variables.scss`: generic variables like sizes, paddings, z-indexes and such.

### Breakpoints

It's quite usual for web apps to be designed around containers. These are containers (for lack of a better word) that take on different sizes depending on the size of the screen. What size they take and at what breakpoints they change sizes depends on the design of the page. Luckily this project allows for quick configuration of breakpoints and containers.

On the `variables.scss` file you'll find the `breakpoints` variable that looks something like this:

```scss
$breakpoints: (
  xl: 1400px,
  lg: 1200px,
  md: 992px,
  sm: 768px,
  xs: 576px,
);
```

Each breakpoint is identified by its biggest threshold. For example, the small breakpoint (`sm`) is for screens with width between 577px and 768px. You can modify, add and remove breakpoints as long as the order is preserved (biggest first).

Sometimes you might need to display items in rows. We've got support for that! The `genericItemContainer` class will automatically display its direct children in rows. You can quickly configure how many items you want to see on each row per threshold by modifying the `items-per-row` variable, which looks something like this:

```scss
$items-per-row: (
  xl: 5,
  lg: 4,
  md: 3,
  sm: 2,
  xs: 2,
  xxs: 1,
);
```

On the `xl` breakpoint the container will render rows of five items, but on the `sm` breakpoint rows allow at most two items. Note that in order for this to work like it does, the items are sized pixel-perfect(ly). One caveat of this is that the generic item container **must** be used directly inside a `genericContainer`, otherwise measurements will fail and everything will look really bad.

### Text Styles

Design systems will sometimes define text styles centrally and reference them across the whole design of the product. This is ideal for developers since it allows us to easily replicate the design system on the codebase and reference styles centrally.

The `text-styles.scss` file is meant to be used to document the text styles of the design system. Using mixins to generate the classes with less code is a good idea.

### Caveats

Sass is great, CSS Modules is great. Together, they have the potential of becoming a powerhouse in frontend styling. Sadly their integration has some caveats.

#### Importing a Sass file from a module

It's important to know that the Sass transpiler runs before the modules are interpreted. Let's assume you have a module file named `my-module.module.scss`. Inside that file we import a different Sass file wich defines a `generic` class.

```scss
/* my-module.module.scss */
@import 'path/to/a/file.scss';

.container {
  @extend .generic;
  font-size: 15px;
}
```

```scss
/* path/to/a/file.scss */

.generic {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

Due to how modules work, each time we import that generic file a new set of classes will be generated, effectively duplicating its code each time we import it from a module. This is completely undesireable since it generates useless amounts of CSS. There's no simple solution to this, other than applying a simple rule: **never** import a Sass file that is transpiled to non-empty CSS from a module. You are allowed to import files that don't generate CSS by themselves. A file that defines some mixins is allowed, since it doesn't transpile to actual CSS.

Want to have some generic classes to use on components? Import the file from the component itself and not from the Sass module:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

import myLocalModule from './my-component.module.scss';
import myGlobalModule from '../../assets/stylesheets/global-module.module.scss';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div className={[myLocalModule.container, myGlobalModule.generic].join(' ')}>
    { /* More code here */ }
  </div>
)
```

This will ensure that only a central version of the global CSS code is used. This project includes a file named `global-styles.module.scss` that should be used to export all global CSS.
